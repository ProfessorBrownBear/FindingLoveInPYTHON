Sure, I'll create a simple Python code example for a basic dating app scenario with four objects that interact with each other. The scenario will involve:

1. A `User` class representing individual users.
2. A `UserDatabase` class containing an array (list in Python) of `User` objects.
3. A `MatchingEngine` class to match users based on their interests.
4. An `AppInterface` class as the main interface for user interactions.

Each user will have a list of interests. The `MatchingEngine` will use these to find potential matches from the `UserDatabase`.

Here's a basic implementation:

### 1. User Class

```python
class User:
    def __init__(self, name, interests):
        self.name = name
        self.interests = interests

    def get_interests(self):
        return self.interests
```

### 2. User Database Class

```python
class UserDatabase:
    def __init__(self):
        self.users = []

    def add_user(self, user):
        self.users.append(user)

    def get_all_users(self):
        return self.users
```

### 3. Matching Engine Class

```python
class MatchingEngine:
    def __init__(self, user_database):
        self.user_database = user_database

    def find_matches(self, user):
        matches = []
        for potential_match in self.user_database.get_all_users():
            if user != potential_match and set(user.get_interests()).intersection(potential_match.get_interests()):
                matches.append(potential_match)
        return matches
```

### 4. App Interface Class

```python
class AppInterface:
    def __init__(self):
        self.user_database = UserDatabase()
        self.matching_engine = MatchingEngine(self.user_database)

    def register_user(self, name, interests):
        new_user = User(name, interests)
        self.user_database.add_user(new_user)
        return new_user

    def get_matches_for_user(self, user):
        return self.matching_engine.find_matches(user)
```

### Example Usage

```python
# Initialize the App Interface
app = AppInterface()

# Register some users
alice = app.register_user("Alice", ["hiking", "reading", "music"])
bob = app.register_user("Bob", ["music", "movies", "gaming"])
carol = app.register_user("Carol", ["reading", "gardening", "music"])

# Find matches for Alice
alice_matches = app.get_matches_for_user(alice)
print("Matches for Alice:")
for match in alice_matches:
    print(match.name)
```

In this example:
- Users are created with their interests.
- They are added to the `UserDatabase`.
- `MatchingEngine` takes `UserDatabase` as an input and provides a method to find matches based on common interests.
- `AppInterface` integrates all these components. It allows registering users and finding matches for them. 

This is a simplified version for illustration purposes. In a real-world scenario, you would need more robust data handling, error checking, and potentially a more sophisticated matching algorithm.
